# 0002: OCA_bundle_archive
- Authors: Carly Huitema
- Status: PROPOSED
- Status Note: none
- Supersedes: none
- Start Date: 2023-02-10

## Summary
To specificy an archival, human-accessible version of the OCA bundle for data preservation. When archiving data, the data could be stored with both the machine-actionable OCA Bundle, and the more human readable OCA_bundle_archive versions.

## Motivation
For archiving data (specifically research data) we are thinking of time scales of 50+ years of accessibility after creation. Requirements for a datasets schema to be this accessible are:
- Human readable
- Easy to read
- Low tech (.txt)
- Contains some helper information to aid interpretation
- Easy to generate from an OCA bundle for easy development

There are also mandates for depositing data that the material must be accessible (e.g. in a non-propriatary format, easy to use and understand)

## Tutorial
An author of an OCA Bundle has elected to create the archival version for storage together with their data.
